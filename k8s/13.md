`visits` content for each pod:

```sh
§ kubectl exec pod/moscow-time-app-0 -- cat /project/data/visits
1⏎
§ kubectl exec pod/moscow-time-app-1 -- cat /project/data/visits
10⏎
§ kubectl exec pod/moscow-time-app-2 -- cat /project/data/visits
10⏎
```

### Explanation

I visited my app in 1st tab 1 time, in second tab 10 times and in 3rd private tab 10 times.

As official docs says: "Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods."

Since StatefulSets guarantee that each Pod has a unique, stable network identity, each tab I open connected to a different but the same on each reload Pod, and thus incrementing the visit count for that specific Pod.

### StatefulSet is unnecessary

at least, because:

- We need to track global visits, not for each pod;
- App is mostly stateless and doesn't need to know about other visits;
- App doesn't have any startup dependencies, so it doesn't matter in which order the pods are started or stopped.
